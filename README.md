# C-Multilayer-Perceptron

Multiplayer Perceptron meant to be used in an evolutionary network, but can be adapted into a gradient descent model.

#TODO 
Enable creating a network whose weights closeley resemble another's. To be used to repopulate population after evaluating training data and culling models with bad weights. DONE

Enable creation of training loop where an array of networks are passed in, and many predictions are made on each of them. Sort network array from lowest cost member to highest cost member, cull a certain amount of the worst performers, and repopulate with the better performers. DONE

Make dataset, perhaps some type of logic gate simulation. DONE

Enable loading and testing many training samples in series DONE

Enable saving and loading model weights from an external file.
